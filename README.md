How to Execute/Use Program
==========================

The code included is a java program that can be compiled and run via command line. A basic user interface allows the user to simply enter number inputs for 
selecting what the program can do. The user can input a puzzle, randomly generate 1 or many puzzles, or have the program read a samples.txt file of many puzzles for automatic solving. All puzzles can be specified to be solved via heuristic one or two.

Note that samples.txt should be in the same directory as the program for it to be read. output.txt should also be generated in the same directory.
